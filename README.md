# Guildmaster
A simple dungeon crawler made as a study of Uneal C++/Blueprint. It aims to have a basic dungeon with progression based on solving physics and logic based puzzles hidden inside. We also aim for basic combat via magic spells and simple tracking enemy AI.

Part of an independent study with [JoeKnome](https://github.com/JoeKnome/) to learn how to create gameplay within Unreal Engine 4. The study splits its focus between both Unreal C++ and blueprinting. Both of us had little to no prior Unreal experience.

In addition to various other video and in-editor tutorials, [Ben Tristem's Unreal course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse/) is one of the main supplementary course materials.
